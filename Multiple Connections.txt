This is to allow multiple connections on your VPN

E.g. if you are giving away a free vpn config on a group, you would want everyone to able to connect instead of it disconnecting one user if another person connected to it so multiple users can connect at the same time.



sudo su

chmod 777 /etc/openvpn/server.conf

cd /etc/openvpn/server.conf

nano server.conf


add this to the list: duplicate-cn

then save it.
